It also provides a third pane that can be used to inspect objects in your environment, help pages, figures created by your code etc.\n",

Pay attention to the numbers in the `[ ]` next to the cells - this tells you the order in which cells were executed.\n",
    "- you might want to create a new cell for your own experimentation, instead of editing/overwriting the pre-exisiting example cells. This will help you to avoid getting stuck after having deleted a working example. If you do get in a muddle, you have a couple of options: pressing 'ctrl+z' will undo the most recent changes in a cell, just like you're probably used to; or you can copy/paste the cells from this notebook if you have it open in a browser.\n",
